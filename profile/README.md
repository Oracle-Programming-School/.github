Oracle-Programming-School is non-profit organization & community of developers and software engineers. Our primary goal is to help people in development and guide them in their career. In our community we share our techincal skills and discuss new technologies.

It’s true – when you lend someone a helping hand, you feel a lot better about yourself, and you will likely learn something new.

Helping others feels so rewarding because you know that you have contributed something very important to humanity. And what better way to help your fellow developers than to join one of the many developer communities out there?

## What are Developer Communities?
Over the past few years lots of developer communities have come together with different goals and missions. But you'll probably agree with me that they all have several things in common:

They help you learn,
They share ideas
They offer support to newbies, and
You can freely interact with them and within them.
There are many different types of developer communities out there – front-end focused, back-end focused, and specific language-based. We also have general communities which include all of the above under one platform.

The good thing about this community is that you can not only ask questions and get programming tips, but you also get career advice and learn how to get started coding.
